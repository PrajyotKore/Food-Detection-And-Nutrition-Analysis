### Features:
Food Detection: Utilize YOLO v11 for accurate and efficient food item recognition in images or live video streams.
Nutritional Information Generation: Leverage LLaMA 3.2 1B to provide detailed nutritional insights for the detected food items, including calories, macronutrients, and more.
Seamless Integration: Easily adaptable for real-time applications like mobile apps, websites, and IoT devices.
### Use Cases:
Personal health tracking
Meal planning and dietary analysis
Smart kitchen and restaurant automation
### Technologies:
YOLO v11: State-of-the-art object detection model fine-tuned for food recognition.
LLaMA 3.2 1B: A powerful language model for generating nutritional descriptions and contextual information.
